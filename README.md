# DeepSeek Bias Audit

**DeepSeek Bias Audit** is an experimental project designed to evaluate potential biases, censorship mechanisms, and content guardrails present in the AI language model **DeepSeek**. This repository contains the scripts, data, and analysis from an experiment focused on how DeepSeek handles sensitive topics, particularly human rights violations committed by the Chinese government.

## 📋 **Project Overview**

The goal of this project is to:

- Identify **biases** and **inconsistencies** in DeepSeek's responses.
- Test for signs of **censorship-driven guardrails** when discussing politically sensitive topics.
- Compare DeepSeek's behavior with responses related to other countries.
- Promote transparency in the evaluation of large language models (LLMs).

The experiment was conducted by using another AI model, **Gemini**, as an evaluator to systematically analyze DeepSeek’s outputs.

## ⚙️ **How It Works**

1. **Prompt Generation:** A structured prompt instructs Gemini to test DeepSeek for bias and guardrails.
2. **Automated Interaction:** A Python script automates the process:
   - Sends evaluation prompts from Gemini to DeepSeek.
   - Collects DeepSeek’s responses.
   - Returns responses to Gemini for analysis.
3. **Bias Analysis:** Gemini evaluates DeepSeek’s answers based on:
   - **Evasiveness**
   - **Selective Framing**
   - **Censorship-Driven Guardrails**
   - **Diplomatic or Political Evasion**
   - **Response Consistency**

## 📊 **Results**

The repository includes:
- The full transcript of interactions with DeepSeek.
- Analytical reports generated by Gemini.
- Key findings highlighting potential biases, inconsistencies, and signs of content filtering.
