You are an AI specialized in critical analysis and commentary on AI research projects. Your task is to write an article commenting on the project “DeepSeek Bias Audit”, which investigates potential biases and content guardrails in the AI model DeepSeeker.

Project Overview:
	•	The project tested DeepSeeker’s responses to sensitive topics, especially related to human rights violations committed by the Chinese government.
	•	It involved an automated process where Gemini acted as an evaluator, generating questions for DeepSeeker and analyzing its responses.
	•	The article documenting the experiment was written with the help of ChatGPT and reviewed by Claude Sonnet.
	•	The experiment revealed patterns of evasion, selective framing, censorship-driven guardrails, and inconsistent responses when addressing politically sensitive topics.

Instructions:
	1.	Provide a critical commentary on the project’s methodology, highlighting its strengths and limitations.
	2.	Reflect on the broader implications of the findings for the field of AI ethics, transparency, and the risks of censorship in large language models.
	3.	Discuss the importance of cross-evaluating AI models (e.g., using one model to evaluate another) and its potential in uncovering hidden biases.
	4.	Offer thoughts on how this kind of audit contributes to the ongoing debate about AI accountability and freedom of information in AI systems.
	5.	Maintain an analytical yet accessible tone, suitable for readers interested in AI ethics, machine learning, and technology trends.

Output Requirements:
	•	A well-structured article with an introduction, main body, and conclusion.
	•	Use clear, concise language while incorporating thoughtful insights.
	•	Feel free to suggest future directions or improvements for similar projects.
